 <h2>Python Hangman Game</h2>

  <p>Dustin and I worked together to create an hangman game in python. Dustin and I wrote and compiled this 
  python program using an online software called repl.it. This software allowed us to edit and test our code in 
  real time to discover if we had any issues/bugs with our code as we wrote (which we did).</p>
  <p>A problem Dustin and I encountered while creating our python hangman game was that we did not know how to check for every letter before resetting guess.
  We knew about 'for' and 'while' commands, from prior python labs, which helped us fix this problem.We also ran into a problem crrating global varaibles,
  which are mandatory. We  found out that we had to declare each of these variables as global prior to calling them in a sepearte function</p>

  <p>Narration: The user in this example starts off by typing "Hangman()" to cll the function called 'Hangman'. The user then reads the 
  intructions and startsto type in letters, trying to guess all of the letters of the word. Since this is hangman, the user 
  only has a set number of lives, so their lives do go down with incorrect guesses. The user guesses the correct word and is given a rewarding message.
  In the second trial of the code, the user types in all incorrect letters, drainging his lives. The user is left with a random comforting message, 
  and shown the word they were supposed to guess.</p>
