    <p>Leonardo and I created an app called Unicorn Hunt, the objective of the app is to hunt (tap) the
unicorns, as if you were the horse, while they dashed across the screen. The unicorns have
varied sizes and speeds, making it a challenge for the user to tap them in time. While making
the app, my partner Leonardo and I encountered many problems, that were a challenge to
resolve.</p>
<p>A problem encountered while building the app was creating a branding screen. This simple
screen created a hard time for my partner and I as we tried to base it off the the tutorial lab
which turned out to be for a website. Basing our code off of the lab set us behind, but after
looking through the different categories of code we found a solution. The solution my partner
and I found was to add a timer to the screen, and after the timer turned to ‘disabled’ the screen
would close and open ‘Screen2’. Another problem was finding compatible images while were
were choosing our unicorn. A solution my partner and I came up with was to create a
compatible image ourselves through the online image editing software, Pixlr. The software
allowed us to create a transparent background, if this problem was not resolved our unicorn
would have a white background, making the game look choppy. A problem I solved
independently was how to make the unicorns re appear at the origin point after being tapped. To
resolve this I created a timer which showed the explosion image for a set amount of time, then
set all of the images to their starting point. Although this only had to reset one image, the
selection of the image was random so we had to reset all images to account for the fact that any
image could have been chosen. Our partner and I worked through these setbacks, and were
able to finish our app with time to spare.</p>
