 <h2>Python Interactive Story</h2>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">  
  
  
  
  <p>Jayden and I worked together to create an interactive story in python. Jayden and I wrote and compiled this 
  python program using an online software called replt.it. This software allowed us to edit and test our code in 
  real time to discover if we had any issues/bugs with our code as we wrote (which we did).</p>
  <p>A problem Jayden and I encountered while creating our python intercative story was that we did not know how to add time in between scripts popping up.
  We knew about 'msleep' commands, which I knew from prior experience from robotics. We found out that we had to import a library called time to add these delays. These delays were not mandatory but 
  were for personalization. We also ran into a problem adding ASCII art, also not mandatory. We  found out text on multiple lines did not add like normal text, ad we needed to add 3 quotation marks.
  We found this out from researching online.</p>
